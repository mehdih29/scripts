  ##  RequiredAcks is used in Produce Requests to tell the broker how many
  ##  replica acknowledgements it must see before responding
  ##   0 : the producer never waits for an acknowledgement from the broker.
  ##       This option provides the lowest latency but the weakest durability
  ##       guarantees (some data will be lost when a server fails).
  ##   1 : the producer gets an acknowledgement after the leader replica has
  ##       received the data. This option provides better durability as the
  ##       client waits until the server acknowledges the request as successful
  ##       (only messages that were written to the now-dead leader but not yet
  ##       replicated will be lost).
  ##   -1: the producer gets an acknowledgement after all in-sync replicas have
  ##       received the data. This option provides the best durability, we
  ##       guarantee that no messages will be lost as long as at least one in
  ##       sync replica remains.
